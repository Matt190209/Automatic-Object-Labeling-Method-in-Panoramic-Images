Instructions for Working with Panoramic Images:

In this folder, you can add your panoramic images from your own database to work in an orderly manner. Additionally, a Python script is provided that will allow you to generate a cube with your panoramic images. This will prevent them from overlapping and help your machine learning model interpret them correctly.

Steps to follow

1. Add Panoramic Images:

Place your panoramic images in this folder. Make sure they are in the correct format (for example, .jpg or .png).

2. Run the Script in Python:

The convert_pano.py script is located in this folder. This script will generate a cube from your panoramic images.
To run the script, open a terminal, navigate to this folder and run the following command:

python convert_pano.py

Script Objective:

The convert_pano.py script aims to process your panoramic images and generate a cube so that the images do not overlap.
This is crucial so that the machine learning model can interpret them accurately and efficiently.
