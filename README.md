# Automatic-Object-Labeling-Method-in-Panoramic-Images:

## Project Overview

Our method for automatically labeling objects in panoramic images leverages advanced computer vision techniques to classify objects in urban and road environments. By minimizing human intervention, we streamline the image analysis process, making it more efficient and scalable. This project is built using PyTorch, a powerful open-source machine learning library, enabling us to implement state-of-the-art models and achieve high accuracy in object detection and classification tasks.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Dataset:** Contains a dataset of previously labeled images, designed for retraining already pretrained models. Additionally, it provides the ability to enter revised data, allowing you to continue improving model learning and increasing its accuracy over time.
- **Data:** It is the destination folder where you should add the panoramic images to use
- **TrainModels:** Contains the two different Machine Learning methods for labeling panoramic images.
- **Requirements_fast.txt:** Requirements file with the dependencies of the Fast R-CNN code
- **Requirements_yolo.txt:** Requirements file with the dependencies of the Yolo_V8 code
