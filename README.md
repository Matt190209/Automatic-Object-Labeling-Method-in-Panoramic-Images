## Main Features

- **Minimization of Human Intervention:** Automates the labeling of objects in panoramic images, reducing the need for manual intervention.
  
- **Advanced Computer Vision Techniques:** Uses techniques such as transfer learning and fine tuning to accurately classify objects.
  
- **Efficiency and Precision:** Seeks to optimize efficiency and precision in the identification of objects in urban and traffic environments.
  
- **Training Process:** Uses recognized models such as YOLOv8 and Fast R-CNN for training and tuning the algorithms.

Here you can add a description of the results obtained using Fast R-CNN.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **Dataset:** Contains a dataset of previously labeled images, designed for retraining already pretrained models. Additionally, it provides the ability to enter revised data, allowing you to continue improving model learning and increasing its accuracy over time.
- **Data:** It is the destination folder where you should add the panoramic images to use
- **TrainModels:** Contains the two different Machine Learning methods for labeling panoramic images.
- **Requirements_fast.txt:** Requirements file with the dependencies of the Fast R-CNN code
- **Requirements_yolo.txt:** Requirements file with the dependencies of the Yolo_V8 code
