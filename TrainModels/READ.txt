Image Detection Models

In this folder there are two image detection models:

YOLOv8 model: To label normal and panoramic images.
Fast R-CNN Model: For object detection and classification.

Model Description

YOLOv8:

This model is used to label both normal and panoramic images.
YOLOv8 is known for its speed and accuracy in object detection.

Fast R-CNN:

Used for detection and classification of objects in images.
Fast R-CNN offers improved accuracy and is suitable for applications that require detailed analysis of images.
